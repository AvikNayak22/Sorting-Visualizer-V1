**Bubble Sort Animation**
This is a JavaScript implementation of the bubble sort algorithm, with a graphical animation of the sorting process.

**Getting Started**
To run the code, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. This will display a set of bars representing an array of random numbers. Click the "Sort" button to animate the bubble sort algorithm and watch the bars move into their sorted order.

Bubble Sort Animation
This is a JavaScript implementation of the bubble sort algorithm, with a graphical animation of the sorting process.

Getting Started
To run the code, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. This will display a set of bars representing an array of random numbers. Click the "Sort" button to animate the bubble sort algorithm and watch the bars move into their sorted order.

How It Works
The init() function initializes the array with random values and shows the bars.

The play() function creates a copy of the original array, sorts it using bubble sort, and gets the list of moves made. Then it animates the moves using the animate() function.

The animate() function shows the bars with the current move highlighted and waits for a short time before making the next move.

The bubbleSort() function performs bubble sort on an array and generates the list of moves made.

The showBars() function displays the bars representing the values in the array, with the current move highlighted if provided.
